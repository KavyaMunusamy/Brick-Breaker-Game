# Brick-Breaker-Game
Welcome to the Brick Breaker Game repository! This is a classic arcade-style game built using Java, where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The goal is to clear the screen of bricks by hitting them with the ball, all while avoiding letting the ball fall past the paddle.
